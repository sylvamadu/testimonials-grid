                        I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some 
                        people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
                         course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                         The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course,
                         I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code.
                 I needed some structure from professionals who can help me
                  learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll 
                  by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
                   about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. 
                   They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. 
                   The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my 
                   learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
                    In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of
                     my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job 
                     as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
